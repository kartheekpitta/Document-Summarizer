# Document-Summarizer
This project is a PDF Document Summarizer that uses Huggingface's BART-Large CNN model and LangChain's pipeline to generate concise summaries from large PDFs. It supports bulk processing, extracting text, splitting it into chunks, and creating embeddings with HuggingFaceEmbeddings. Summaries are saved in /outputs/summary.txt. Leveraging FAISS for embeddings, it enables future upgrades like semantic search or Q&A. Designed for researchers, students, and professionals, it’s lightweight, scalable, and easily extendable for chatbots or report generation. With minimal setup, it’s Colab-ready and GitHub-friendly, ideal for processing hundreds of documents efficiently.
